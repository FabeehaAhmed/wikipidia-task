        <h3>Arguments for and against [edit]</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Peter A. Ubel, an American physician, is a proponent of scientocracy. In an article titled "Scientocracy:
            Policy
            making that reflects human nature", he writes, "When I talk about Scientocracy, then, I'm not talking about
            a
            world ruled by behavioral scientists, or any other kind of scientists. Instead, I am imagining a government
            of
            the people, but informed by scientists. A world where people don't argue endlessly about whether educational
            vouchers will improve schools, whether gun control will reduce crime, or whether health savings accounts can
            lower health care expenditures,... but one instead where science has a chance to show us whether vouchers,
            gun
            control laws, and health savings accounts work and, if so, under what conditions."[1]</p>
        <p>Bernard Boudreau, a Canadian lawyer and politician, is a critic of scientocracy. He writes, "At the dawn of
            the
            21st century, scientific dogmatism is more firmly entrenched than ever. The scientist has become the high
            priest
            of the industrial world, certifying both the academic training of new users and the relevance of types and
            means
            of production. In all areas of human discourse, scientific reasoning has the force of law. What was once a
            theocracy is now a 'scientocracy'".[2]</p>
        <p>Deepak Kumar, a historian, has written about the "Emergence of 'Scientocracy'" in India.[3]</p>
        <h3>Earliar use [edit]</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Florence Caddy (1837–1923) wrote a book titled Through the fields with Linnaeus: a chapter in Swedish
            history.
            That book was published in two volumes in 1887. In volume 1 she wrote, "His lesson in Hamburg had taught him
            that a novus homo must not be arrogant when he enters the society of the scientocracy, and that he must not
            run
            himself rashly against vested interests. Yet for all his poverty, Carl Linnaeus seems to have lived in
            intimacy
            with the scientocrats of Leyden—Van Royen, Van Swieten, Lieberkuhn, Lawson, and Gronovius."[4] In these two
            sentences she uses "society of the scientocracy" and "scientocrats" to refer to groups of eminent scientists
            of
            that time.</p>
        <p>In 2018 the theory was re elaborated by two italian intellectuals and artists, Giovanni Tartaglia and
            Vincenzo
            Nerone, as an achievable distopia: the scientocracy Is the term that defines a new era that will be ruled by
            mathematics. The term itself has been considered a political satire towards the upgrowning request of
            science
            knowledge among the youngest part of the population, which has been forced to adapt to the requests of the
            market in order to survive</p>
        <p>In 1933, Hugo Gernsback defined scientocracy as "the direction of the country and its resources by Scientists
            and
            not by Technicians".[5]</p>
